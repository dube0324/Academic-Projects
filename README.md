# Data Analytics Projects

- Exploratory Data Analysis - [Bollywood Movies](DataAnalyticsProjects/BollywoodMovieAnalysis.ipynb) & [Cereal Ratings](DataAnalyticsProjects/CerealRatingAnalysis.ipynb): In these notebooks, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis on two datasets by using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- [Recommendation System](DataAnalyticsProjects/CollaborativeFiltering.ipynb): In this notebook, we build a Recommendation System using the Collaborative Filtering technique on the MovieLens Dataset.
- [Association Rule Mining](DataAnalyticsProjects/MarketBasketAnalysis.ipynb): In this notebook, we extract rules using Association Rule Mining and perform Market Basket Analysis by setting appropriate values of Lift, Support, and Confidence.
- [Sentiment Analysis](DataAnalyticsProjects/SentimentAnalysis_NGrams.ipynb): In this notebook, we perform Sentiment Polariy Analysis by preprocessing the data - converting to lowercase, removing punctuations, expanding contractions, etc. We also perform N-Gram analysis of reviews.
- [Time Series Analysis](DataAnalyticsProjects/TimeSeriesAnalysis.ipynb): In this notebook, we forecast the unemployment rate using Time Series Models like ARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMA, and SARIMAX.

- [Variance Inflation Factor](MachineLearningProjects/VarianceInflationFactor.ipynb): In this notebook, we analyze the Variance Inflation Factor to remove Multicollinearity and improve the accuracy of the Machine Learning model.

# Deep Learning Projects

- [Hyperparameter Tuning](DeepLearningProjects/HyperparameterTuning.ipynb): In this notebook, an Artificial Neural Network was trained to perform Prediction of Body Fat. The hyperparameters
of the network were tuned and the corresponding accuracy and loss for each combination was plottted and analyzed.
- [LeNet CIFAR10](DeepLearningProjects/LeNet_CIFAR10.ipynb): In this notebook, the LeNet architecture was trained and tested on the CIFAR10 dataset.
- [LeNet MNIST](DeepLearningProjects/LeNet_MNIST.ipynb): In this notebook, the LeNet architecture was trained and tested on the MNNIST dataset.
- [AlexNet Cats & Dogs](DeepLearningProjects/AlexNet_Cats&Dogs.ipynb): In this notebook, the AlexNet architecture was trained and tested on the Cats & Dogs Dataset.
- [Transfer Learning](DeepLearningProjects/VGG16_InceptionNet_ResNet_EfficientNet_MobileNet_Horse2Zebra.ipynb): In this notebook, the Keras Applications
API was used to implement Transfer Learning of the **VGG-16/ InceptionNet/ ResNet/ EfficientNet/ MobileNet** on the Horse2Zebra dataset.
- [Time Series Modelling](DeepLearningProjects/TimeSeriesModelling.ipynb): In this notebook, a Vanilla RNN was used to predict stock price using 50 timesteps.
- [LSTM & Bidirectional RNN](DeepLearningProjects/LSTM_BidirectionalRNN.ipynb): In this notebook, a Long-Short-Term-Memory Network and a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network was trained
and tested on the IMDB Reviews Dataset for Sentiment Analysis.
- [Functional API](DeepLearningProjects/FunctionalAPI.ipynb): In this notebook, the Functional API was used to train a branched Neural Network and its performance was compared with that of
the Sequential API.
- [Wide & Deep and Deep & Cross Networks](DeepLearningProjects/WideDeepCrossNetworks.ipynb): In this notebook, the wide part is a linear model using sparse representation, 
the deep part is a feed-forward network using dense representation, and the cross part applies explicit feature crossing.


In all the above notebooks, we perform some preprocessing including handling missing values, scaling numeric data, encoding categorical data, and preprocessing as per the dataset given.
